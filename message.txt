In this article Beginner-level CSS tutorials Intermediate-level CSS tutorials Advanced-level CSS tutorials CSS Tutorials
Learning CSS may be a daunting task.
In order to help you, we have written numerous tutorials about CSS.
Some are aimed at complete beginners, while others present complex features to be used by more experienced users.

This page lists them all, with a short description.
They are grouped by complexity so that you can choose the most appropriate for your level.
Beginner-level CSS tutorials
CSS basics

This guide is aimed at complete beginners: You haven't written one single line of CSS? — this is for you.
It explains the fundamental concepts of the language and guides you in writing basic stylesheets.

Using multiple backgrounds

Backgrounds are fundamental for nice styling: CSS allows you to set several of them on each box. This tutorial explains how they interact and how to achieve nice effects.

Resizing background images

CSS allows you to resize images used as an element's background.
This tutorial describes how to achieve this in a simple way.

Using media queries

The size of the screens, or the kind of devices like touchscreens or printed sheets vary greatly nowadays.
Media queries are the fundamental building blocks in building websites that render everywhere in their best quality.

Understanding CSS z-index

Controlling superposition of boxes is a basic feature that is very quickly needed by Web developers.
Though not that difficult, it requires a basic knowledge of CSS.

Intermediate-level CSS tutorials
After the release of CSS 2 (Level 1), new features have been added to CSS.
Some of them are fancy and are pretty self-contained.
They are easy to use for anybody with a fair knowledge of basic concepts.

CSS Counter Styles

Counting items and pages is an easy task in CSS. Learn to use counter-reset, counter-increment, counters(), and counter().

CSS Animations

CSS Animations allow you to define configurations of style, as keyframes, and to transition between them defining an animation.

CSS Transitions

CSS Transitions allow you to define an animation between several styles and to control the way this transition happens.

CSS Transforms

Transforms allow you to change the position of elements by modifying their coordinate space: it allows for translating, rotating, and deforming them in the 2D or 3D spaces.

CSS Gradients

Gradients are images that transition smoothly from one color to another.
There are several types of gradients allowed in CSS: linear or radial, repeating or not.
This tutorial describes how to use them.

Advanced-level CSS tutorials
CSS also got new features allowing you to create complex layouts.
Though the simplest way to achieve such layout, they are more complex to use for people without too much experience.

CSS multi-column layouts

CSS3 introduces a new layout allowing you to easily define multiple columns in an element.
Though multi-column text is not that common on devices like screens, this is particularly useful on printed pages, or for indexes.

CSS flexible boxes layouts

This new layout allow you to give boxes flexibility, allowing them to be resized smoothly.
It is a powerful way to describe complex interfaces.

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style and enhance HTML documents. It defines the presentation of HTML elements on a web page, enabling changes to fonts, colors, sizes, spacing, column layouts, and animations.
In this CSS tutorial, we will cover both basic and advanced concepts, including CSS properties, selectors, functions, media queries, and more.
What is CSS? CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and enhance websites. It controls how HTML elements—such as text, images, and buttons—are displayed on a webpage. With CSS, you can adjust font sizes and colors, add backgrounds, and manage the layout, transforming a basic webpage into a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. CSS also simplifies layout management across multiple web pages by using external stylesheets stored in CSS files.
Different Ways to Use CSS CSS has three ways to style the HTML:
Inline: Add styles directly to HTML elements using the style attribute (limited use). Internal: Place styles within a tag inside the HTML file, usually within the section External: Create a separate CSS file with a .css extension and link it to your HTML file using the tag. Table of Content

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML.
What are the types of CSS? There are three types of CSS which are given below:
Inline CSS: Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached to the element. Internal or Embedded CSS: The CSS ruleset should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e. the CSS is embedded within the HTML file. External CSS: External CSS contains a separate CSS file that contains only style properties with the help of tag attributes. How do I link an external CSS file to an HTML document? Use the element within the section of your HTML document. Example:
What is the purpose of the ‘box model’ in CSS? The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS that describes the layout of elements. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin, which collectively determine the size and spacing of an element.
How can I center an element horizontally and vertically in CSS? To center horizontally, use margin: auto; on the element. For vertical centering, consider using Flexbox (display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;) or Grid (display: grid; place-items: center;).
What is the difference between ‘margin’ and ‘padding’ in CSS? Margin is the space outside an element, creating space between the element and its surrounding elements. Padding is the space inside an element, creating space between the element’s content and its border.
How do media queries contribute to responsive design in CSS? Media queries allow developers to apply styles based on characteristics such as screen width, height, or device orientation. They are crucial for creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML. Prerequisites Before starting this module, you should have:

Basic familiarity with using computers and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)
A basic work environment set up, as detailed in Installing basic software, and an understanding of how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files.
Basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the Introduction to HTML module.

Note: If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch.
Guides This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of CSS, and provide opportunities for you to test out some skills.

What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

Getting started with CSS

In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical things about the language along the way.

How CSS is structured

Now that you have an idea about what CSS is and the basics of using it, it is time to look a little deeper into the structure of the language itself. We have already met many of the concepts discussed here; you can return to this one to recap if you find any later concepts confusing.

How CSS works

We have learned the basics of CSS, what it is for, and how to write simple stylesheets. In this article, we will take a look at how a browser takes CSS and HTML and turns that into a webpage.

Assessments The following assessment will test your understanding of the CSS basics covered in the guides above.

Styling a biography page

With the things you have learned in the last few articles, you should find that you can format simple text documents using CSS to add your own style to them. This assessment gives you a chance to do that.
